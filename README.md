# Bitwise manipulation example
 A C++ example for bitwise operations.

Feel free to use this in any way for educational purposes.
A shout out would be appreciated.

Functions in BitUtil are used to manipulate the individual bits that represent the integer "registers",
You can use bit masks like "int mask = 0b00101;"  to be able to modify multiple bits at once.

I'll comment and extend info about this when I have time.
